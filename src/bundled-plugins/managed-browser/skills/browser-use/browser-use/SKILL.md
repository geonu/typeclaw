description: Browser Use CLI for driving the shared TypeClaw browser from Python snippets over CDP. Use for browsing, clicking, scraping and screenshots when you prefer Python helpers.

# browser-use

The `browser-use` CLI runs a Python snippet with browser helpers pre-imported. `$BU_CDP_WS` points it at the shared browser. If the variable is unset, this session's role cannot use the shared browser (it needs the `browser.shared` permission) or the browser failed to start; the operator log (`typeclaw logs`) names which. Do not try to start Chrome yourself.

```bash
browser-use <<'PY'
new_tab("https://example.com")
wait_for_load()
print(page_info())
PY
```

Run `browser-use skill` once to read the full helper reference (`ensure_real_tab`, `click_at_xy`, `cdp(...)`, screenshots). Its tabs are marked with a horse emoji in the title; keep to those.

Never run `browser-use --update`, `browser-use auth login`, or remote/cloud daemons (`start_remote_daemon`): the version is pinned by TypeClaw and cloud browsers are not part of this setup.

## Shared browser rules

- One TypeClaw-managed Chrome serves every engine and every session that has `browser.shared`. Logins and tabs persist across bash calls and sessions.
- Work only in tabs you opened. Never navigate or close a tab another engine or session is using.
- Files: downloads land in `$TYPECLAW_BROWSER_FILES`; to upload a file, copy it there first and pass that path. Chrome cannot see other paths.
- The browser runs in its own sandbox with no view of the agent folder, so `file://` URLs outside `$TYPECLAW_BROWSER_FILES` fail by design.
